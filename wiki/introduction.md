# Introduction
During my time at Fermilab, I discovered the most important ingredient for enjoying each task and accelerating the learning curve: guidance. Without it, we often find ourselves lost in a maze of trial and error, the worst place to be. These dead ends neither teach us valuable lessons nor help us make progress.

That's why I created this guide: to assist anyone facing similar tasks who may not know where to begin.

In this tutorial, we will follow these steps:

1. **Theoretical Foundations**: We'll start by introducing some fundamental blocks that are almost always present in any FPGA design, regardless of the model or manufacturer.
2. **Required Resources**: Next, we’ll discuss the resources needed to understand and apply these concepts, specifically tailored for the RedPitaya 125-14 FPGA.
3. **Practical Tutorials**: Finally, we’ll walk through three tutorials:
   - Adding two numbers
   - Adding negative numbers
   - Adding arrays of numbers

**Premises** \
Before starting, it is highly suggested to first follow [this tutorial](https://github.com/dspsandbox/FPGA-Notes-for-Scientists) to get a foundational understanding. It will make the following steps much easier to grasp.  
In that tutorial, you will find the IP libraries necessary for this guide, the `.xdc` file required for hardware mapping of the RedPitaya, and the board presets to upload in Vivado.
